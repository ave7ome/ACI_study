IPN - inter-pod network
	All IPN devices should be interconnected
	To reduce geographical link distribution, port-channel between devices on same location may be used
BUM - Broadcast, unknown unicast, multicast traffic in ACI
RP - Rendezvous point in multicast routing (one of routers in l3 network between pods)
	 Multicast can be split up between RPs
GIPo - Multicast group
Configuration zones - to prevent admin from configuring something he didn't want to (show usage also)
ARP Glean (used when ARP flooding is disabled)
		  - if spine doesn't have info on where is the destination of ARP request is connected,
			fabric generates ARP request from IP associated to BD. This ARP request is sent
			out all the leaf nodes edge interfaces part of BD. In Multi-pod, ARP glean request
			is also sent to remote Pods across the IPN
	  -!IP for BD must be configured
	  -!IPN should be properly configured to handle ARP glean multicast traffic (239.255.255.240)

In multi-pod scenario, maximum supported latency between pods is 50ms!
New spine in new multi-pod environment can only join to it if it has at least an operating leaf connected to it
Requirement for connectivity between 2 pods is being able to complete an ARP exchange


-why exactly IS-IS (not something else) in ACI?
-different BGP instances, same ASN?

-IGMP (multicast in IPN)
-PIM Bidir (multicast in IPN)
