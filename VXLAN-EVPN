Underlay - physical network infrastructure used in the traffic exchange
Overlay - logical scheme built on top of underlay to simplify and reflect it as L2 directly connected network devices or L3 interconnected network devices

For overlay, signalling is required to manage the status of end network device

Signalling options:
    Data plane learning. Like learning in basic switches; VXLAN Flood&Learn; FabricPath
    Learning happes when traffic is passed over
    +Address discovery
    +Tunnel management
    -Service discovery

    Control plane. 
    +Endpoint discovery
    +Connection announcement
    +Tunnel Management
    +Connection and additional service reservation
    Control protocol (BGP, IS-IS, LISP) between leaves OR centralized DB on controller (OVS,VSM)
    "Push" (information is pushed by leaves proactively, BGP, IS-IS, controller) OR "Pull" (information is requrested by leaves on-demand and cashed - LISP, DNS, controller)
