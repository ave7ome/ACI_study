#                    VXLAN (as an independent protocol)
VXLAN allows L2 packets to be successfully traversed over the L3 network.

Usual Frames (with ETHERNET header included) are being encapsulated and following are being added to them:
    1. VXLAN header (8 Byte)
    2. UDP header (8 Byte)
    3. IP header (20 Byte)

    Above is called "MAC-IN-IP/UDP" 
    UDP/4789 is used.

    Also ETH header adds up 14 Bytes. (18 Bytes with VLAN data, but usually it gets added to VXLAN header)
    Since L2 header is not counted up to starting MTU (up to 1500 bytes) of not encapsulated packet.

That means each VXLAN PDU accumulates additional 50 Bytes of MTU to the tunnel.

VXLAN virtual identifier (VNID) allows up to 16 million diffrent values. 
VLAN only allows 4096.

While LISP has ITR and ETR, in VXLAN, routers are called VTEP.

VXLAN is Data Plane protocol only, by itself it cannot move packets in the network since it doesn't know where to move them.
Control Plane protocol is required: 
    - Usually MP-BGP is used for that
    - ACI uses COOP
    - SDA uses LISP
    - EVPN
