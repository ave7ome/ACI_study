Provider EPG - usually a destination endpoint resides here (dst-port here)
Consumer EPG - an enpoint that initiates a connection usually resides here (src-port here)

'#show zoning-rule' (on leaves) to display rules created implicitly and by contracts

VRF enforcement modes:
	unenforced - policy not being applied between EPGs (EPGs can freely communicate with each other)
   |enforced - policy is being applied for communications between EPGs
   |	ingress - policies are stored only on non-border leaves and mostly applied on ingress devices
   |	egress - policies are stored on borded leaves (takes a lot of resources, not recommended)

Inter-VRF route-leak
	configure consumer subnet (BD) to be shared between VRFs
	configure provider EPG subnet to be shared between VRFs and no default SVI gateway
	
for L3OUT: "Shared route cotrol subnet" + "Shared security import subnet"
L3OUT EPG subnet - "external subnet for external EPG"

preferred groups - a set of EPGs in BD, no contracts needed for traffic between EPGs in that group
vzAny - all EPGs in VRF (cannot be used as provider in inter-VRF contract)

Inter-tenant contracts:
	-Inter-tenant intra VRF (contract in tenant 'common')
	    contract in tenant common can be accesses by any tenant hence configuration is simply to configure
		provider EPG and consumer EPG for chosen tenants
	-Inter-tenant inter-VRF (contract in tenant 'common')
		same as previous but route-leaking between VRFs should be configured as well
	-Inter-tenant inter-VRF (contract in any user tenant)
		same as previous but since contract now cannot be acceses by any tenant by default, contract should
		be created in tenant that contains provider EPG, then it can be exported to other tenant and addressed
		as consumed contract interface

Contract master - take all rules from master EPG
		
Microsegmentation (uSeg) features:
			Intra-EPG isolation - total isolation of traffic between EPs in EPG
			Intra-EPG contract - an access policy for EPs in same EPG communication
			uSeg EPG - so-called micro EPG, a set of EPs within one EPG grouped by some attribute (IP, MAC, VM attribute)

uSeg EPG:
	requires 'ingress' VRF enforcement mode;
	uSeg EPG domain must be configured to match the base EPG domain;
	base and uSeg EPG(s) must be in the same BD, BD must have an IP subnet;
	part of vzAny and supports preferred group, intra-EPG isolation, intra-EPG contracts as well;
	in physical domain, static-leaf mapping should be defined to let ACI know which leaves should be programmed with policies.
	
ESG (Endpoint Security Group) (group of EPs from different EPGs):
		it's a security zone;
		not bound to the BD;
		works across entire VRFs;
		do not have network-related config such an subnets;
		security rules are defined by using contracts between ESGs;
		contracts between EPGs and basic ESGs are not possible (between L3OUT EPG and ESG - possible)
		
QoS in ACI:
		deals with class and marking to place traffic into one of the Qos classes;
		each QoS class represents a class of service and is equivalent to a 'qos-group' in Cisco NX-OS;
		each class of service maps to a queue or a set of queues in hardware;
		|QoS configuration at the contract and the contract subject specifies the assignment of the traffic to a given qos-group (qOS class) based on the source EPG, destination EPG and filters;
		|custom QoS configuration at the EPG specifies the assgnment of the traffic to a given qos-group based on the dot1p or DSCP values of the incoming traffic from that EPG;
		|QoS class configuration at the EPG defines which qos-group based on the traffic from that to which the EPG belongs if none of the other previous criteria are matched;
		
Priority of QoS in ACI:
	1. Contract subject QoS priority
	2. Contract QoS class
	3. Non-L3OUT source EPG custom QoS policy
		3.1. If L3OUT - Custom QoS policy at L3OUT logical interface profile. Applied to traffic coming into ACI through L3OUT interface
	4. Non-L3OUT source EPG QoS class
		4.1. If L3OUT - QoS priority at L3OUT logical interface profile (same as 3.1.)
	5. If no QoS class is specified - traffic is assigned with Level 3 QoS class
	
**QoS config for L3OUT EPG only take effect for ingress traffic, for egress - subject or contract QoS config should be used
**to modify CoS (Class of Service) of traffic. For that, VRF enforcement egress mode is required
		
Priority for DSCP is the same as QoS priority in ACI (but no p.4):		
	1. Contract subject DSCP
	2. Contract DSCP
	3. Non-L3OUT source EPG custom QoS policy (DSCP configurable there)
		3.1. If L3OUT - Custom QoS policy (DSCP configurable there) at L3OUT logical interface profile. Applied to traffic coming into ACI through L3OUT interface
	5. If no DSCP is specified - traffic is assigned to 'Unspecified'

for L3OUT same applied as in **

vsh -c 'show logging ip access-list internal packet-log deny/permit' '| grep VRF_scope' shows logs for policy matches in leaf CLI
'show logging ip access-list cache {deny|permit} [detail]' shows flow statistics in leaf CLI

'show system internal policy-mgr stats' shows hitcounts for contract rules


'Stateful' option in filter entry requires an ACK flag presence for packets going from provider EPG back to consumer EPG 
	does not prevent SYN + ACK attack from provider

Policy compression cannot be enabled if Stateful option in Filter entry is enabled


L3OUT EPG:
	for L3OUT EPG with subnet 0.0.0.0/0, the EPG class ID (pcTag) is special;
		for destination in zoning-rule, class ID is 15;
		for source in zoning-rule, class ID equals VRF class ID;
	
	
Contract priorities:
	Specific EPG wins over vzAny of preferred groups
		EPG-to-EPG (7,9), EPG-to-vzAny (13,15), vzAny-to-EPG (14,16), vzAny-to-vzAny (17,20)
		specific source wins over specific destination
	
	Specific L4 rule wins
		specific filter wins over 'any' filter
		specific destination port wins over specific source port
		
	Deny action wins, specific protocol wins
		deny+log wins over deny, deny wins over redirect or permit (even if permit has specified ports)
		between redirect and permit, more specific protocol and specific L4 port wins
		
Exact zoning-rule priorities are in ACI contracts Whitepaper, p.120-121

Between redirect and permit:
	specified L4 port wins;
	if both ports specified, destination port wins over source port;
	if ports are similar, redirect wins over permit.
	if ports are overlapping (ex. dst-tcp/22 and dst-tcp/22-80), priority is not deterministic

Exact filter priorities are in ACI contracts Whitepaper, p.129

Taboo contract - to deny and log traffic to specific EPG

Out-of-band (OOB) contract - applies to OOB traffic from the MGMT tenant
OOB EPG configuration - ACI contracts Whitepaper, p.135-?

'Tiles' are user to perform routing functions or filtering functions and so on (default values in parentheses):
	MAC address table (24K)
	IPv4 (24K)
	IPv6 (12K)
	LPM table (20K)
	Policy Cam table (filtering/contracts) (64K)
	Routed Multicast entries (8K)

Is scalable - can be more that defaults above (different profiles at p.138-139)

Resolution immediacy - controls when VRF, BD and SVI are pushed (programmed) to the leaf nodes
	p.142 for clarifications
Deployment immediacy - controls when contracts are programmed in the hardware
	p.142 for clarifications
