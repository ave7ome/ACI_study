EP - Endpoint
BD - Bridge domain
PBR - Policy-based Redirect

Bounce entry - used when EP is moved to other leaf, it points to a new leaf where EP is now located
(630sec age)   since 3.2(2l) it sends out the update to all leaves when bounce entry ages out

Unicast routing(BD) - if it's turned on, leaves will learn MAC and IP
				      if it's turned off, leaves will learn MAC only. Subntes configured under BD aren't pushed to leaves, routing don't occur
					  Also if it's off, BD will only be used for l2 communications, EPs in that BD should have their default gateways outside CISCO ACI
					  If you turn it off from being enabled, IPs are flushed from EP table for BD (before 3.1(1i) also MACs were flushed
					  
L2 Unknown Unicast(BD) - may have different options
						 option "Flood"
						 option "Hardware-Proxy" drops L2 unicast packets on the spine if destination MAC has not been learned 
							anywhere on the BD in ACI and the COOP database doesn't have the information

Silent host detection - For L3 routed traffic to an unknown IP, leaf will generate an ARP request from its BD SVI IP
    (ARP Gleaning)      toward unknown IP to detect and learn the unknown IP. Only one leaf with BD SVI IP will generate ARP request
                        usually it's triggered by the spine when it can't find unknown IP, even in COOP database.
						Happens regardless of configuration (L2 unknown unicast or ARP flooding) as long as traffic is routed 
						to unknown IP. It's sent to Multicast group of BD (all interfaces of BD)
						
ARP flooding(BD) - if ARP flooding is enabled, ACI fabric will flood the ARP request within the BD - silent hosts will receive packet 
						and respond
				   if ARP flooding is disabled, fabric will perform unicast routing against target IP, if it's silent host and unknown 
						to leaf and COOP, ARP gleaning will be performed

GARP (Gratuitous ARP) - an ARP reply initiated without ARP request				   
				   
---L3out learning:
Local endpoint learning; packet from l3out to ACI – only source MAC is learned as local EP (IP is not learned)
Remote endpoint learning; packet from l3out to ACI – no MAC nor IP learned as a remote EP, originating leaf not added
                                                     (only retention timer updated)
Remote endpoint learning; packet from ACI to l3out - no MAC nor IP learned as a remote EP if the VRF mode is "ingress policy enforcement"
                                                     (only observed when packet to l3out is from 1st gen leaf switch)
													 

---EP learning optimization:
													 
DSR - Direct server return. 
	  Deployed mainly when large amount of return traffic is coming from server
	?
	  Disables learning IP from data-plane. Only control-plane (ARP, GARP, neighbor discovery) from EPG with DSR virt IP configured

GARP based EP move detection - when IP of EP moves from MAC #1 to MAC #2 (when both are from same EPG)
							   Only works when unicast routing and ARP flooding enabled							
													 
Enforce subnet check(BD)      - If enabled, fabric will learn only IP addresses for subnets configured on the BD (can be certain BD)
(Limit IP learning to subnet)	to check if it's enabled: "vsh -c 'show system internal epm vlan vlan-id detail'"
                                and look for "Learn Enable" option, should be Yes
													 
Endpoint Dataplane Learning - this option enables and disabled EP data-plane IP learning (restricted to PBR cases)												 
							  if this is disabled, Limit IP learning to subnet option will not appear in APIC GUI					 
													 
IP Data-Plane Learning (VRF) - this option enables and disabled EP data-plane IP learning on VRF													 
							   when disabled, behavior is as follows:
									-local MACs and remote MACs are learned via data-plane (no changes here)
									-local IPs are not learned via data-plane
									-local IPs are learned from ARP/GARP/Neighbor discovery via the control plane
									-remote IPs are not learned from unicast packets via the data plane
									-remote IPs are learned from multicast packets via the data plane
													 
Disable remote EP learn (Fabric) - applies on border leaves. To disable remote EP IP learning at border leaves on VRFs, which have 
	ingress policy enabled													 
													 
Enforce subnet check(VRF) - superior to same BD option and applies to whole fabric (all VRFs, cannot be only one)
	                        available only since 2nd gen leaf switches
							works as BD option, but works for all BDs 
						  >>if traffic originated within BD#1 between two leaves 
						  >>and source IP is part of BD#2, it will be added to EP table	
							difference from BD option: 
								-BDoption is learning MAC nonetheless
								-VRFoption prevents MAC learning, but MACs still can be learned in case of bridging (l2) traffic
								 because in that case, IP header is not checked hence cannot be filtered by VRFoption
